[MESSAGES CONTROL]

# Disable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You
# can either give multiple identifiers separated by comma (,) or put this
# option multiple times (only on the command line, not in the configuration
# file where it should appear only once). You can also use "--disable=all" to
# disable everything first and then reenable specific checks. For example, if
# you want to run only the similarities checker, you can use "--disable=all
# --enable=similarities". If you want to run only the classes checker, but have
# no Warning level messages displayed, use "--disable=all --enable=classes
# --disable=W".

[REPORTS]

# Python expression which should return a score less than or equal to 10. You
# have access to the variables 'error', 'warning', 'refactor', and 'convention'
# which contain the number of messages in each category, as well as 'statement'
# which is the total number of statements analyzed. This score is used by the
# global evaluation report (RP0004).
evaluation=10.0 - ((float(5 * error + warning + refactor + convention) / statement) * 10)

# Set the output format. Available formats are text, parseable, colorized, json

# mypackage.mymodule.MyReporterClass.
